## ðŸ‘‹ Aspiring Software Developer and Data Analyst

With a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science from UC San Diego. Currently teaching robotics and coaching students in STEM, I thrive on solving real-world problems through codeâ€”whether thatâ€™s building efficient backend tools or analyzing data for actionable insights.

I have hands-on experience with Go, Python, C++, SQL, Docker, AWS, Linux, and PostgreSQL, and am passionate about continuous learning and growth. My projects include:

- **BlogAggregator**: A multi-user RSS feed aggregator CLI in Go, enabling users to follow and browse feeds seamlessly.
- **PokedexCLI**: A performant CLI tool that fetches, caches, and lets users explore PokÃ©mon data.
- **Graph Algorithms in C++**: Implemented optimized pathfinding solutions using BFS and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithms.
- **NBA Salary Prediction Model**: Built a machine learning model leveraging player stats and decision trees to forecast salaries.
- **Handwritten Digit Classifier**: Achieved over 95% accuracy through careful data cleaning and model tuning.

Certified in AWS Cloud Practitioner, Docker, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, S3 & CloudFront, SQL, HTTP Clients/Servers in Go, and Memory Management in C.

With my background in both teaching and development, I bring strong communication skills and a collaborative mindset. I am eager to contribute to a team of curious, driven professionals and work on meaningful projects that make an impact.
